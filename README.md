<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Garden Tracker was designed to assist gardeners in planning and organizing their gardens tasks, including tracking seed starting, planting, and harvest dates, as well as where the plants or seeds came from to make planning and purchasing for future years a breeze. 

The app also includes growing guides about specific plants, and frost dates by zone - which can be identified by zip code - so that gardeners have all the information they need in one app.

Users can create multiple gardens, designate their primary garden, as well as add, edit, and delete plant information.


### Built With
Garden Tracker was built and deployed as a mobile-reponsive, full-stack web app. The frontend of the project was built using React, written in JavaScript. The backend of the project was created with Node and Express and a PostgreSQL database to store user information and gardening guides. 

The Phzmapi API was implimented to allow users to find their gardening zones by zip code. Login information is encryted using Bcryptjs and routes on both the front and back ends require JWT authorization.

The frontend was deployed on surge and the backend was deployed on Heroku.
